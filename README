I use surf as my web browser on Gentoo Linux.

First see: https://surf.suckless.org

---------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------
All changes i make are preceded by comments starting with "ada", so
that they can be easily traced by searching for "ada" in the code.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Set my CookiePolicy to "a", ie deny all cookies.
2. Enabled WebGL.
   WebGL is supported (built into WebKit), but the feature is turned
   off by default.
3. Applied patches:
   a. bookmarking. I also needed to create/touch a file "bookmarks"
      in the .surf directory for it to work
   b. homepage. You can change your homepage. See at the end of the
      file config.h

surf - simple webkit-based browser
==================================
surf is a simple Web browser based on WebKit/GTK+.

Requirements
------------
In order to build surf you need GTK+ and Webkit/GTK+ header files.

In order to use the functionality of the url-bar, also install dmenu[0].

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (surf is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install surf (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

Running surf
------------
run
	surf [URI]

See the manpage for further options.

Running surf in tabbed
----------------------
For running surf in tabbed[1] there is a script included in the distribution,
which is run like this:

	surf-open.sh [URI]

Further invocations of the script will run surf with the specified URI in this
instance of tabbed.
